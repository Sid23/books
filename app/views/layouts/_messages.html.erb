<!-- The flash provides a way to pass temporary primitive-types (String, Array, Hash) between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to
  the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts, such as a create action that sets 
  flash[:notice] = "Post successfully created" before redirecting to a display action that can then expose the flash to its template.
  Actually, that exposure is automatically done. -->
